# airflow


Airflow is a platform created by the community to programmatically author, schedule and monitor workflows.

In this project we built a pipeline using three tasks. The first task consist of gather data about apple stock (using apple api), the second task consist of create the bucket in s3. And at last we send the data we collect to aws-s3 without storing it in local disk.
